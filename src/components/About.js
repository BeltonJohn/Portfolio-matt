        <p>
          I’m a junior software developer with a background in environmental
          science and education. I started coding in the pandemic and decided to
          take my curiosity a step further by completing a 480 hour full stack
          Software Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly. I love
          the power of what can be achieved with backend development as much as
          I enjoy thinking about the functionality, aesthetics and overall user
          experience of frontend development.

          I have a passion for nature having obtained an honors degree in
          Environmental Science many moons ago. When I’m away from my machine I
          can usually be found outdoors with my dog. I found her living in a
          cave in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Spain and brought her back to
          the UK last year.

          I previously worked as an English teacher in Asia and Southern Spain
          and therefore love to cook and apply engineered solutions to recreate
          cuisines and dishes I used to eat. During the pandemic I built a wok
          burner in pursuit of achieving wok hei and the perfect fried rice.

          I have a fondness for strength sports. As well as going to live
          strongman events as a spectator I enjoy training to strength building
          parameters and lifting heavy, awkward objects.

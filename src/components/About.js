        <p>
          I’m a software developer with a background in environmental science
          and education. Having started to code in the pandemic I decided to
          take my curiosity a step further by completing a 480 hour full stack
          Software Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly. I love
          the power of what can be achieved with backend development as much as
          I enjoy thinking about the functionality, aesthetics and overall user
          experience of frontend development.

          I have a passion for nature having obtained an honors degree in
          Environmental Science many moons ago and when I’m away from my machine
          I can usually be found outdoors with my dog. I found her living in a
          cave in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Spain and brought her back to
          the UK last year.

          Having previously lived and worked in Asia and Southern Spain I love
          to cook and apply engineered solutions to recreate cuisines and dishes
          previously enjoyed. During the pandemic I built a wok burner in
          pursuit of achieving wok hei and the perfect fried rice.

          Other interests persued in my free are strength sports. As well as
          going to live strongman events as a spectator I enjoy training to
          strength building parameters and lifting heavy, awkward objects.
